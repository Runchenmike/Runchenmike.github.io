        <h2>Methodology</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Materials are selected and characterized using AFM and optical microscopy.</li>
            <li>Stacks are transferred to a flexible substrate, allowing mechanical stress application.</li>
            <li>Electrodes measure electronic parameters in a low-temperature, high-magnetic-field environment.</li>
        </ol>
