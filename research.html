        <div class="content">
            <p>This research explores moiré patterns in two-dimensional superlattices, focusing on the manipulation of these patterns by applying mechanical stress to graphene and hBN layers.</p>
            <p>We used atomic force microscopy (AFM) to find 42nm and 24nm thick hexagonal boron nitride(hBN) that could be used as the bottom hBN andMid-hBN. Next, We have found some graphene that appears to have the same lattice orientation as Mid-hBN and the right shape under optical microscopy. After finding all suitable samples, we successfully stacked them together on a Si/Sio2 substrate. Afterwards, in order to apply stress to change the shape of the moire, we successfully transferred it to a plastic substrate and successfully applied stress through PMMA.</p>
            <p>The complete build of the electrodes has been carried out. After electrode building is done, the top-down Nanolithography was done through photolithography. Upon conduction of the top-down nanolithography experiment in correspondence to the features of the substrate detection, it was detected that the current pathway is normal.</p>
            <p>The change and distribution of resistance and current density under different magnetic field intensity were measured at 4K temperature. We can clearly see the split of the Landau level and the secondary Dirac points. That means we've managed to find and change the size and shape of moire.</p>
            <p>At present, the shape and size of moire have been successfully changed by applying stress under the condition of 4K strong magnetic field, and the changes of its resistance and current density have been tested. It is proved that the scheme of changing the shape of moire by applying stress to PMMA is feasible.</p>
