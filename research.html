        <h2>Moiré Patterns in 2D Materials</h2>
        <div class="content1">
            <p>This research explores moiré patterns in two-dimensional superlattices, focusing on the manipulation of these patterns by applying mechanical stress to graphene and hBN layers.</p>
            <p>We used atomic force microscopy (AFM) to find 42nm and 24nm thick hexagonal boron nitride(hBN) that could be used as the bottom hBN andMid-hBN. Next, We have found some graphene that appears to have the same lattice orientation as Mid-hBN and the right shape under optical microscopy. After finding all suitable samples, we successfully stacked them together on a Si/Sio2 substrate. Afterwards, in order to apply stress to change the shape of the moire, we successfully transferred it to a plastic substrate and successfully applied stress through PMMA.</p>
            <p>The complete build of the electrodes has been carried out. After electrode building is done, the top-down Nanolithography was done through photolithography. Upon conduction of the top-down nanolithography experiment in correspondence to the features of the substrate detection, it was detected that the current pathway is normal.</p>
            <p>The change and distribution of resistance and current density under different magnetic field intensity were measured at 4K temperature. We can clearly see the split of the Landau level and the secondary Dirac points. That means we've managed to find and change the size and shape of moire.</p>
            <p>At present, the shape and size of moire have been successfully changed by applying stress under the condition of 4K strong magnetic field, and the changes of its resistance and current density have been tested. It is proved that the scheme of changing the shape of moire by applying stress to PMMA is feasible.</p>

    <h2>Algae Evolution Algorithm Research</h2>

            <p>Objective: The aim of this research is to simulate and analyze the distribution patterns of aquatic algae plants using advanced deep learning algorithms. This study is pivotal for understanding and predicting algal blooms, which have significant environmental and economic impacts.</p>
            <p>Methodology: I contributed to the research by utilizing Python for the development of a simulation model. This model predicts the distribution of algae based on various environmental parameters and biological factors.</p>

            <h3>Physical Logic</h3>
            <p>Initially, a portion of algae is randomly placed in a lake with varying terrain below a horizontal plane. The algae then undergo first-generation growth and reproduction. Typically, algae in higher terrain grow better and produce more seeds, making their first-generation seeds higher than those in lower terrain areas. Due to algae spore reproduction relying on "biological transfer" and "water flow transfer," in higher terrain, where fish life is more abundant and water flow moves towards lower terrain, the second-generation seeds will disperse from high to low terrain, with parent and offspring distances being relatively far. In contrast, seeds in lower terrain, due to lesser water movement and the physical phenomenon of underwater eddies, will largely perish or propagate towards higher terrain, with parent and offspring distances being relatively close. Since algae compete with each other, there is a limit to the number of algae in a region. After selecting the second generation, the same logical analysis and iteration process is repeated.</p>

            <h3>Mathematical Logic</h3>
            <p>Initially, the quantity of algal plants is considered as the fitness function/fitness value. Random coordinates and points are selected within the area, their corresponding fitness values are calculated and ranked; thereafter, the second generation evolves in order from high to low fitness. That is, points with high fitness will have more points selected around them for the next fitness calculation, with a greater distance from the previous points, while points with low fitness will select points towards the direction of high fitness points, with a smaller distance from the previous points. Additionally, the principle of competition is introduced, meaning that the number of points in an area cannot exceed a threshold value.</p>

            <h3>Fluid Mechanics Insights</h3>
            <div class="highlight">
                <p>In fluid mechanics, the movement of water towards lower terrain can be explained by the physical fluid mechanics equations of mass conservation and momentum conservation.

Firstly, consider the mass conservation equation, which indicates that under steady-flow conditions, the water flow rate through a particular cross-section should remain constant. Assuming two positions on the same horizontal plane, one at a higher elevation and the other at a lower elevation, the lower position has a smaller vertical height, requiring less gravitational potential energy to overcome. Therefore, according to mass conservation, the water flow rate through the lower position is larger, keeping the overall system's water flow constant.

Secondly, consider the momentum conservation equation, which states that in the absence of external forces, the total amount of momentum in the fluid remains constant in steady flow. At two positions on the same horizontal plane affected by gravity, which points towards lower terrain, according to momentum conservation, the water flow will accelerate when passing through the lower position because the gravitational force provides additional momentum. This leads to an increase in water flow speed, causing the water to flow more quickly towards the lower terrain. In fluid mechanics, the momentum conservation equation explains why water flow accelerates when passing through lower terrain.</p>
