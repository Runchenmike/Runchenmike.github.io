        <p class="title">Moiré Patterns in 2D Materials</p>
        <div class="content">
            <p>This research explores moiré patterns in two-dimensional superlattices, focusing on the manipulation of these patterns by applying mechanical stress to graphene and hBN layers.</p>
            <p>We used atomic force microscopy (AFM) to find 42nm and 24nm thick hexagonal boron nitride(hBN) that could be used as the bottom hBN andMid-hBN. Next, We have found some graphene that appears to have the same lattice orientation as Mid-hBN and the right shape under optical microscopy. After finding all suitable samples, we successfully stacked them together on a Si/Sio2 substrate. Afterwards, in order to apply stress to change the shape of the moire, we successfully transferred it to a plastic substrate and successfully applied stress through PMMA.</p>
            <p>The complete build of the electrodes has been carried out. After electrode building is done, the top-down Nanolithography was done through photolithography. Upon conduction of the top-down nanolithography experiment in correspondence to the features of the substrate detection, it was detected that the current pathway is normal.</p>
            <p>The change and distribution of resistance and current density under different magnetic field intensity were measured at 4K temperature. We can clearly see the split of the Landau level and the secondary Dirac points. That means we've managed to find and change the size and shape of moire.</p>
            <p>At present, the shape and size of moire have been successfully changed by applying stress under the condition of 4K strong magnetic field, and the changes of its resistance and current density have been tested. It is proved that the scheme of changing the shape of moire by applying stress to PMMA is feasible.</p>

    <h2>Xiaoming Zhang's Algae Evolution Algorithm Research</h2>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Objective: The aim of this research is to simulate and analyze the distribution patterns of aquatic algae plants using advanced deep learning algorithms. This study is pivotal for understanding and predicting algal blooms, which have significant environmental and economic impacts.</p>
            <p>Methodology: I contributed to the research by utilizing Python for the development of a simulation model. This model predicts the distribution of algae based on various environmental parameters and biological factors.</p>
             <div class="section">
            <h2>Physical Logic</h2>
            <p>Initially, algae are randomly placed in a lake with varying terrains. The first generation of algae that grow in higher terrains tend to develop well and produce more seeds. These seeds disperse towards lower terrains influenced by "biological transfer" and "water flow transfer," with a notable distance between parent and offspring generations. Contrarily, seeds in lower terrains, affected by minimal water movement and underwater eddies, tend to perish or move towards higher terrains with closer parent-offspring distances. An area's algal capacity is limited due to competitive interactions among algae.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Mathematical Logic</h2>
            <p>The quantity of algal plants serves as the fitness function/value. Points within an area are randomly selected and ranked based on their fitness values. Evolution proceeds from points with high to low fitness, influencing the selection of points for subsequent generations based on distance and directional criteria. Additionally, the competitive principle ensures that the point density does not exceed a threshold, adhering to the principles of mass conservation and momentum conservation in fluid mechanics.</p>

            <h2>Fluid Mechanics Insights</h2>
            <div class="highlight">
                <p>Mass conservation dictates that the flow rate through a cross-section remains constant under steady-flow conditions, favoring areas of lower elevation due to reduced gravitational potential energy requirements. Momentum conservation, meanwhile, explains the acceleration of water flow through lower terrains due to gravitational force, increasing flow speed towards these areas. These principles from fluid mechanics elucidate why water preferentially flows towards and accelerates in lower terrains.</p>
